                    <h3>Welcome to my humble online abode! Remember to take off your shoes and hang your coat at the door... All jokes aside, thanks for visiting my site! I made this site with the intent for it to be a place to share my data science personal projects as a portfolio website as well as a place to share my thoughts on any topics I want to talk about. Who knows maybe I'll be able to build up a community like Ken Jee (I'm a big fan of his if that wasn't apparent!)</h3>

                    <h4>In my very first full cycle data science personal project I decided to analyze data from a popular website among the anime community, myanimelist.net. The concepts that I specifically wanted to test my hands at were web scraping, natural language processing and linear regression through machine learning. As being able to acquire and analyze data are some of the most tasks that define a data scientist. Of course I didn't neglect to carry out proper data cleaning and data visualizations practices as well.</h4>
