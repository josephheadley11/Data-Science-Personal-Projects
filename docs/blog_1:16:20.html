                <p><h4>Order is important and I don’t mean that in any sort of ideological, Civilization 5 mindset (Thank you to anyone who got that reference). I mean that in order to be able to effectively do the things that matter most to you, organization and prioritization are essential skills to guide you through the process. I would wager that these are not new concepts to anyone and much less so “hot takes” in the public ethos and that everyone has some semblance of structure that they hold onto and use often. Although in retrospect, I find that my skills in ordering the things around me have been pragmatic at best. Taking things as they come, one task after the other, never having time to just….... breathe.</h4></p>
                <p><h4>After the hiatus to normal life brought about by Covid, I had time to truly pause and do some well needed introspection to figure out where I’m going and what I want to do with my life. For the longest time, I felt this feeling of complacency that I just couldn’t shake. Sure, I had agency in making choices, but it often seemed like I made these choices out of convenience rather than an inherent passion and that convenience would take me down a path in life that might not be something I’m fully invested in. Enter Data Science. There was something about data science and how it blended what I considered my favorite parts of physics and computer science (coding, analyzing data, and making actionable insights from said analysis) that just felt so exciting to me! I finally found a field where I could apply myself to learning, growing, and challenging myself in a way that I found enjoyable and where I could see tangible results of my hard work.</h4></p>
                <p><h4>“But Joey what does all of this have to do with the title?” I can imagine you asking. Well, if you’ve gotten this far in the post, I’d like to thank you for patiently bearing through my well-intentioned ramblings. So why did I learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make this website? I think I’ll answer the general interpretation of this question first and that’s to say I view this website of course as a way to share my work and thoughts but more so as a contract to uphold. A contract that I am making to encourage myself to do more data science work and see a future with myself in the role of a data scientist wherever that may be. I want to learn as much as I can about as much as I can because that’s what defines a data scientist and that’s what I want to define me. I feel comfortable making and upholding this contract because that’s how enthusiastic I am about data science. I found the thing I feel most passionate about and I want this website to be a poignant reminder of that for me.</h4></p>
                <p><h4>Now to answer the more specific interpretation of this question that I had in mind, which is “why did I go through the trouble of learning these languages to make such an unpolished website when I could’ve easily followed one of the templates from GitHub Pages and maybe HUGO?” My biggest reason for taking this path to making a portfolio website actually comes from the website tagline “Joey-Of-All-Trades: Chronicling My Data Science Journey”. Data Science is a field that is and will always be a constant learning experience. If you aren’t able and willing to learn, you will stagnate and be left behind by the ever-evolving world ahead of you. One of the things I’ve been interested in learning about was web development and in wanting to live up to the moniker I came up with I chose to challenge myself to finally act on that interest and learn more about web development to the point where I could make something to call my own from it.</h4></p>
                <p><h4>The fact that the website is unpolished is another silver lining because I want to use this as living proof to display my willingness to learn and grow by chronicling my journey and development as a Data Scientist. As I improve, hopefully this website will improve as well in terms of design complexity among other things. With all that said, I am aware that the full expression is “Jack of all trades, master of none” but if my exclusion of that part doesn’t speak for itself then let me. I have every intention of becoming a “Joey of all trades” and maybe not a master of all but learning at least enough to say I’m well-versed. Thanks for reading!</h4></p>
